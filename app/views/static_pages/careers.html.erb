				<h2>HCJI Career Forum</h2>
			</div>
			<p><img src="assets/careers1.jpg" alt="" width="400px"/>HCJI Career Forum is a 4-day series of events held before and during the annual Boston Career Forum (BCF) that serve as an opportunity for students participating in BCF, to interact and network with companies in a more personal and casual environment on Harvard's campus.</p>
			<p>We provide opportunities for recruiters and students to interact even before BCF begins so that students may network with representatives from various Japanese companies, and companies may do so likewise to their mutual benefit. In 2014, we held four formal information sessions and multiple social events between students and company representatives on Harvardâ€™s campus. A total of 9 companies were represented.</p>
			<p>We also provide housing for non-Harvard students during BCF by connecting them with Harvard students who are willing to host in their dormitories.</p>

			<h2>History</h2>
			<div id="portfolio" class="container">
				<p>HCJI Career Forum originally began as an opportunity for Harvard students to give back to their friends from Japan. Many students from Harvard visit Japan every year on summer schools, internships and research opportunities. Whenever they go and whatever they do, they are always greeted with great care and hospitality ("Omotenashi"). HCF began as an opportunity where Harvard students can give back to this, by inviting Japanese students to stay at Harvard dormitories during the Boston Career Forum. During this weekend, hotel prices around Boston typically become very high and many students have difficulties getting around in a city that is completely new to them. At HCF, we try to make these students feel at home, staying with their friends on Harvard's campus.</p>

				<p>
				In recent years, HCJI Career Forum has grown to become much more than this, turning into a comprehensive platform that welcomes students and recruiters into this community of Japan-loving-international-students. Our collaborations reach far beyond just Harvard related programs as we welcome students from other Ivy schools, Liberal Arts Colleges and even students from the UK to take part in our events. We hope to foster a community in which people who love Japan can connect and collaborate with each other to achieve even greater heights in the future.

			<h2>Networking Session</h2>
			<div id="portfolio" class="container">
				<p><img src="assets/coffee.jpg" alt="" width="400px"  style="padding: 0 75px 0 50px"/>
					The Networking Sessions are opportunities for students to be able interact with recruiters on a more personal and casual environment. These events will take place on a cafe located on Harvard's campus (details TBA) and serve as opportunities for recruiters and students to be able to casually converse and exchange information from the day. These are also great events during which fellow students can get to meet each other and make friends with students who have come from all over the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the 2014 pilot program, 8 companies participated in this event: AIG, Fourth Valley Concierge Corporation, Japan Tobacco Inc., Mitsui-Sumitomo Finance and Leasing Company, MyNavi Corporation, Rakuten Inc., Toray, Works Application. The participating companies for 2015 will be announced soon.

			<h2>Housing</h2>
			<div id="portfolio" class="container">
				<p><img src="assets/housing.jpg" alt="" width="400px" style="padding: 0 75px 0 50px"/>
					We will provide free accommodation for participants of the HCJI Career Forum. During the 4 days from the 19th until the 22nd of November, hotel prices around Boston reach extremely high prices; combined with the flight and travel expenses, students must pay up a large sum to participate at BCF.</p>
				<p> This year, we will be providing free housing on Harvard's campus (and on campuses at nearby universities) by matching participants with students at the university who are willing to host. Many students at these Universities are interested in Japan or have homestayed with families in Japan in the past. These students will be more than happy to meet and greet the participants at BCF and this would be a fantastic opportunities for students on both sides.
