				<h2>HCJI Careers</h2>
			</div>
			<p><img src="assets/careers1.jpg" alt="" width="400px"/>HCJI Careers is a 4-day series of events held before and during the annual Boston Career Forum (BCF) that serve as an opportunity for Harvard students and students who have been involved in Harvard programs in the past, to interact and network with companies in a more personal and casual environment.</p>
			<p>We provide opportunities for recruiters and students to interact even before BCF begins so that students may network with representatives from various Japanese companies, and companies may do so likewise to their mutual benefit. In 2014, we held four formal information sessions and multiple social events between students and company representatives on Harvardâ€™s campus. A total of 9 companies were represented.</p>
			<p>We also provide housing for non-Harvard students during BCF by connecting them with Harvard students who are willing to host in their dormitories.</p>
