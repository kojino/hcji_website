				<h2>HCJI Explore</h2>
			</div>
			<p><img src="assets/careers1.jpg" alt="" width="400px"/>HCJI Explore welcomes high school students from all over Japan to "explore" the life at Harvard. We provide them with unforgettable experiences through our on-campus tours, presentations and workshops. All of these programs are created and coordinated by HCJI members and other Harvard student volunteers.</p>
			<p>We offer high schools interested in a more global curriculum a unique opportunity to incorporate on-the-ground experiences at Harvard into their programs. Most programs will be modified as we move towards the actual visit in order to fulfill the needs of individual schools.</p>
